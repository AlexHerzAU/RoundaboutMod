DISCLAIMER: I hereby declare that I do not own the rights to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. No Copyright Infringement Intended.

The Roundabout mod is meant to be a Jojo mod for Minecraft that fits well into the core gameplay loop, 
and attempts to imagine how abilities from the franchise would interact with the world of the game.

Permission is granted to create addons or contribute freely to the project. The official release will
only accept contributions which fit the intended vision of the mod. Check the license for details
(it's pretty unrestrictive)

We are not liable for any problems this mod may cause.
